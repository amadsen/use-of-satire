----

### Visual Regression Tests

----

### Integration Tests

Test the application working with the next level of services it relies on.

----

### End-to-End Tests

Test the application from the client (e.g. browser) to the data store, utilizing test versions of all of the intermediary applications and services.

----

### Smoke Tests

Tests run in a production environment to verify that basic functionality is in place

----

### Production Monitoring
